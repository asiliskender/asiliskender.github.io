                <h1>now</h1>
                
                <p>My biggest focus these days is my 6-month-old daughter, who confronts me with something new almost every day and reintroduces me to the world I thought I knew from scratch each time. She's re-educating someone like me, who tends to think they can predict everything, about "how life actually works." So I can say I'm being redesigned from the ground up right now. This is the most noteworthy thing for this now page.</p>
                
                <p>Besides that, I'm currently working as a software factory lead at an OEM, where I'm tasked with designing the software infrastructure for all in-house software the company develops and presenting it to the necessary teams. My goal in this role is to accelerate the company's software development processes and ensure higher quality software output. This position requires both breaking established flows and mindsets (which is very soft-skill intensive) and staying closely up-to-date with technologies. My current interest is transforming a traditional OEM into a place that can develop software.</p>
                
                <p>However, the software factory alone isn't enough for me (at least classic SW) - ML infrastructures interest me much more. The question of what kind of infrastructure and system we need when developing an embedded ML application is more exciting for me. I'm trying to develop myself in this area as well. For now, all I can do is read, read, and read. And experiment with small projects, of course.</p>
                
                <p>When I put all of this together, I realized my mind is quite scattered. I read but it doesn't quite settle into place in my work life. Or even if it does settle, when I want to convey my thoughts on a topic, my mind gets confused. When I thought about the best way to organize my mind, I found writing. To write, you first have to organize your thoughts. Therefore, I'm most interested in writing right now.</p>
                
                <p>I write to learn.</p>
